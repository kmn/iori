Description: deploying and config management tool for LXC
 This software is a command line tool for deploying and config management
 tool of Linux Containers (LXC). When you use LXC, you need to use LXC userland
 command line tool as start with "lxc-*" generally. LXC is provided template
 config file and scripts. But this way if you want to manage from a remote
 contoller host is difficult to treat containers by bulk. So this tool
 controls LXC with libvirt API, and manages these config files with Git
 repository.
 .
 This tool is enable to manage LXC container's multi hosts. It is that one
 branch is managed as one host. Branch name is generated from hostname(or
 FQDN) or IPv4 or IPv6 address. 'master' branch will be using for mapping.
 'template' branch is used for template of each node.
